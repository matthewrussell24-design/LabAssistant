# API Readiness

This page answers one question: which application capabilities are safe to
freeze for an external read-only transport, and what must happen first?

## Decision

Transport implementation is **not ready yet**. The application layer is mature;
tasks 058 and 059 completed the draft response/error boundary, local read
policy, and bounded collections. The final schema-shape/version review remains
before any transport selection.

The first transport should expose only seven read candidates after the bounded
hardening gate below. Registry presence does not imply external stability.

## Classifications

- **Candidate read** — scalar/filter inputs and a read-only serializable result;
  eligible for the first freeze after the common gate.
- **In-process read** — useful read whose inputs are domain objects, workspace
  evidence, paths, file-like sources, or other Python-only collaborators.
- **Sensitive read** — returns full raw source or local scientific-memory
  content and needs an explicit access/content policy.
- **Reviewed write** — changes local evidence or persistence and remains human/
  CLI-only until authorization, confirmation, idempotency, and audit rules exist.
- **Assembly** — returns or consumes mutable domain objects; not a transport DTO.

## First Freeze Candidate

The candidate read surface is:

1. `describe_platform`
2. `describe_agent_access`
3. `list_experiments`
4. `retrieve_history_overview`
5. `retrieve_experiment`
6. `retrieve_related_context`
7. `retrieve_research_journal`

This is a candidate, not an authorization grant. Scientific history, context,
and journal reads require a local access policy even when the first transport is
loopback-only.

## Hardening Gate

Before selecting or implementing a transport:

1. Add one transport-neutral success envelope containing `api_version`,
   `capability`, and `data`.
2. Add one typed error envelope and stable codes for invalid input, not found,
   conflict, unsupported evidence, access denied, and internal failure.
3. Wrap `list_experiments` in a versioned result instead of a bare tuple.
4. Define bounded pagination/limits for history, context, and journal reads.
5. Define the local read-access boundary and ensure store/path collaborators
   cannot be supplied by an external request.
6. Add JSON round-trip/schema-shape tests for all seven candidates.
7. Replace `0.1-draft` only when those tests and rules are complete.

## Current Gate Status

- ✅ Shared success envelope: `APISuccessEnvelope`.
- ✅ Shared typed error envelope and six stable draft codes.
- ✅ Versioned `ExperimentListings` wrapper; `list_experiments()` itself remains
  backward-compatible and returns its established tuple.
- ✅ Bounded reads: lists, history, and journal use limit/offset metadata;
  related context reports honest category bounds and unknown totals.
- ✅ Access: protected reads require a policy-evaluated local context with a
  subject, known client, local origin, and capability-specific scope. This is a
  local host policy, not remote authentication.
- ✅ JSON conformance and failure-mapping tests cover all seven candidates.
- ⬜ Stable version: `0.1-draft` remains correct until the candidate shapes
  receive their final freeze review.

The conformance implementation lives in `labassistant.api_readiness`. It is an
in-process boundary, not a server, remote authentication mechanism, or endpoint
grant. Access context is host-asserted and is never accepted inside request
parameters; loopback alone is not treated as identity.

## Go/No-Go

**No-go for an HTTP server or agent SDK today.**

**Go for the next task:** run the final schema-shape review, add golden contract
fixtures where necessary, and decide whether to promote the seven-read surface
from `0.1-draft` to a stable version. That work still does not choose a
framework, open a port, or grant write access.

## Deliberate Deferrals

- File upload and server-local path APIs.
- DLS workspace/session handles.
- Raw source retrieval.
- Reviewed writes.
- Authentication mechanism selection.
- HTTP framework, process model, deployment, and agent runtime.
